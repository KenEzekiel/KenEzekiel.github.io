# Building Scalable AI Infrastructure at Xendit

As a Software Engineer at Xendit, I've been working on developing internal AI infrastructure using bleeding-edge technology to automate business processes and enhance our core products. This journey has taught me valuable lessons about scaling AI systems in production environments.

## The Challenge

When I joined Xendit's AI infrastructure team, we faced several key challenges:

- **Legacy Systems Integration**: Our existing systems weren't designed with AI in mind
- **Scalability Requirements**: We needed to handle thousands of requests per second
- **Cost Optimization**: Cloud costs were becoming unsustainable 
- **Real-time Processing**: Business processes required near-instantaneous AI responses

## Our Solution Architecture

We designed a microservices-based architecture that could scale horizontally while maintaining low latency:

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

```typescript
// Example of our event processing pipeline
const processAIRequest = async (event: AIRequest) => {
  const result = await aiModelService.predict(event.data);
  await eventBus.publish('ai.prediction.completed', {
    requestId: event.id,
    result,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
};
```

### 2. Model Serving Infrastructure

We implemented a custom model serving layer that handles:
- **Model versioning** and A/B testing
- **Auto-scaling** based on request load
- **Circuit breakers** for fault tolerance
- **Caching layers** for frequently requested predictions

### 3. Data Pipeline Optimization

Our data pipeline processes millions of transactions daily:
- Real-time feature engineering
- Automated data quality checks
- Distributed model training
- Continuous model monitoring

## Key Achievements

**Performance Improvements:**
- 95% reduction in prediction latency (from 2s to 100ms)
- 99.9% uptime across all AI services
- 60% cost reduction through optimization

**Business Impact:**
- Automated 70% of manual review processes
- Improved fraud detection accuracy by 25%
- Reduced customer onboarding time by 50%

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start Simple, Scale Smart
We initially over-engineered our solutions. The key is starting with simple, working systems and adding complexity only when needed.

### 2. Monitoring is Critical
AI systems fail differently than traditional software. We invested heavily in:
- Model drift detection
- Feature distribution monitoring  
- Prediction quality metrics
- Business impact tracking

### 3. Team Collaboration
Success required close collaboration between:
- **Data Scientists** for model development
- **Platform Engineers** for infrastructure
- **Product Teams** for business requirements
- **DevOps** for reliable deployments

## Future Roadmap

We're continuing to innovate with:
- **Edge AI deployment** for ultra-low latency
- **Federated learning** for privacy-preserving ML
- **AutoML pipelines** for faster model development
- **Real-time model updates** without downtime

## Conclusion

Building scalable AI infrastructure is as much about people and processes as it is about technology. The key is maintaining a balance between innovation and reliability while keeping the business impact at the center of all decisions.

The AI landscape evolves rapidly, but focusing on solid engineering fundamentals, comprehensive monitoring, and team collaboration will set you up for long-term success.
